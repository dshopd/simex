							p IMPORTANT! We realize that the crypto-currency, as a variant of collective investment, is badly damaged by reputation. Since this topic was mercilessly exploited and continues to be exploited by various unscrupulous "project engineers". However, it should be understood that most often, in the context of HYIPs, truly high-yielding trend trends are exploited as legend, but in view of initially different goals, laziness, or an elementary inability to organize a real process, they choose a much easier path. The Siberian Kryptomonetny Dvor is our attempt to look at mining as a normal business process: we acquire, configure and launch equipment that processes information for a conditional customer, for which we are paid. There are some new nuances that you need to know, pitfalls, which you need to be able to bypass, the costs that you need to try to reduce - that is, everything, as in ordinary business. We do not overestimate the possible profitability, only dry statistics and a statement of public facts. We will be open to all investors - we will always be able to communicate personally, visit us, see equipment, etc.
							h2 1.0 TEASER.
							p Acquisition of equipment for mining of crypto-currency (GPU) with a total capacity of 2.5 Gh \ s, as part of the project on mining on an industrial scale Siberian Crypto-Mint (Siberian Crypto Mint) (Siberian Crypto Mint - SibCryptMint). Absence of buy-back shares - dividends for the duration of the life of the project (until the insuperable "outlet level" for this equipment configuration). Calculated multiple return on investment.
							p This project is for you if:
							p - You understand what the speech is about, understand the prospect, but because of your basic employment in another sphere, you will hardly be engaged in mining yourself.
							p - You do not understand very well what you are talking about, but as an active investor you are trying various investment options.
							p - You yourself look narrowly at the mining, but do not dare to purchase expensive equipment. In this case - this project gives you the opportunity to "feel the ground" and on a living example to evaluate the profitability and prospects.
							p "You are a skeptical hetter." In this case, even the only investment project of the project will give you the opportunity to formally express your skepticism in the discussions. For we can not deny a person in his most important sociogenic need - the need for communication ...
							h2 2.0 LICKBEZ, GREETING AND INTRODUCTION.
							p ** Before proceeding with the description of the project, it must warn in advance that part of the audience that is well versed in the topic of crypto-currency, blocking , mining, etc .: the project is described in the most accessible language for as wide a range of audiences as possible that part of it that either first collides with similar terms, as well as technologies and phenomena behind them, or is only familiar with them by hearsay. We deliberately do not disclose all the technical nuances of the project and do not delve into the jungle, as potential investors need to understand the essence of the project, to know how much they can earn, and also to be sure that they will not lose everything if "something goes wrong" ".
							p - Crypto currency - e-currency, created on the basis of blockchain technology; 
							p - Blockchain - distributed database of data storage (a multiple-repeated history of all transactions) and a payment system on the basis of which settlements are performed and crypto-currencies function; 
							p - Mining - the process of extraction (earnings) of crypto-currency, by performing mathematical calculations with your equipment to ensure the safety and operability of the network;
